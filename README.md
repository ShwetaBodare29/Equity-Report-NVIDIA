## Investment Thesis
NVIDIA is the clear structural winner in the accelerating AI compute cycle. The company’s integrated full-stack architecture, spanning Blackwell GPUs, Grace CPUs, NVLink/InfiniBand networking, CUDA software, and enterprise AI systems, positions it as the dominant supplier of global AI infrastructure with exceptionally high switching costs.

Our DCF valuation (WACC 10.3%, LTG 3%) supports a 12-month price target of **$275**, implying **55.7% upside** from current levels. Growth is expected to be driven by sustained hyperscaler AI capex, rising enterprise adoption of agentic AI and simulation workloads, and NVIDIA’s continued leadership in high-performance accelerated computing.

We believe the market underestimates the durability of NVIDIA’s AI infrastructure cycle and the long-term value of its software and platform ecosystem. This supports a constructive outlook and a favourable risk-reward profile.

## Key Drivers

### 1. AI Infrastructure Cycle Supports Multi-Year Growth
NVIDIA remains the main beneficiary of rising AI data-centre spending. Hyperscalers and AI specialists are scaling “AI factories” at multi-gigawatt levels, driving strong visibility for GPU, networking, and full-stack system demand through 2030.

### 2. Strong Full-Stack Advantage Led by CUDA and High-Performance Interconnects
NVIDIA’s platform, like CUDA-X, Blackwell, Grace-Blackwell, and NVLink Fusion, continues to widen its competitive lead. Its deep software ecosystem creates lock-in that AMD and custom ASIC vendors struggle to match.

### 3. Margin Stability Supported by Software and Networking Attach
Growing contributions from AI Enterprise, CUDA libraries, Omniverse, and high-margin networking products improve pricing power, drive recurring revenue, and support blended margin strength even as system shipments rise.

### 4. Long-Term Optionality Beyond Data Centres
NVIDIA is expanding into robotics, industrial digital twins, simulation, and AI-enabled devices. These emerging segments provide long-run optionality beyond the current AI infrastructure cycle.

---

## Catalysts
- The volume ramp of Blackwell and Grace-Blackwell systems through FY2026 is expected to accelerate data-centre revenue and support quarterly earnings momentum.
- Additional AI factory and cluster expansion announcements from Microsoft, Meta, Google, AWS, Oracle, and xAI could materially raise demand expectations for NVIDIA’s accelerators.
- Earnings releases and guidance updates may provide visibility into data-centre growth, margin trajectory, and software contribution.
- Continued enterprise adoption of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, DGX Cloud, and Omniverse may highlight expanding recurring revenue drivers.
-	Broader deployment of NVLink Fusion and InfiniBand solutions may strengthen system-level economics and reinforce platform dominance.
-	Modifications to U.S. export restrictions or new export-compliant GPU variants could open incremental demand in China and other restricted markets.

## Valuation Summary
We value NVIDIA using three methodologies: **Perpetuity DCF, Exit Multiple, and Relative Valuation** across Bull, Base, and Bear scenarios.

-	The **Base Case Perpetuity DCF value of $275** is our most reliable indicator of intrinsic value, supported by strong returns, competitive advantage, and multi-year AI infrastructure visibility.
-	The **Exit Multiple valuation of $389** reinforces the view that the market prices NVIDIA as a structural growth compounder.
-	Our valuation range spans **$251 (Bear DCF)** to **$410 (Bull Exit Multiple)**, with the Base Case triangulating toward the mid-$200s to high-$300s.

Overall, all methods indicate **material upside** with no scenario suggesting meaningful downside under reasonable assumptions.

---

## Key Risks
- Hyperscaler capex could moderate after large upgrade cycles.
-	Export restrictions, especially to China, may limit data-centre shipments.
-	Competition from AMD and custom silicon could increase over time.
-	Gross margins may face pressure if system mix rises faster than software and networking. 

---

## Recent Developments
-	NVIDIA unveiled over **80 new scientific supercomputing systems**, adding **4,500 exaflops** of AI performance globally, underscoring the rapid adoption of its accelerated computing stack.
-	The company launched the **Newton Physics Engine** and **Isaac GR00T** robotics model, strengthening its presence in physical AI, simulation, and autonomous systems.
-	NVIDIA is shifting AI server designs toward **LPDDR-based memory**, which may tighten supply and significantly raise server-memory pricing by late 2026.
  

---

## Final Recommendation
We initiate coverage with an **Overweight / Buy** rating.  
NVIDIA’s full-stack AI leadership, multi-year data-centre growth, expanding software ecosystem, and strong valuation support a **$275 price target** and **55.7% implied upside**.

NVIDIA remains one of the strongest structural growth stories in modern technology.
